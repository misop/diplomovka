\chapter{Implementation}

We have implemented a system, where users can load and edits skeletons from files, or start by scratch from one skeletal node.
Our system is based on model-view-controller pattern.
Model is stored in $BMMAlgorithm$ and $BMMNode$ classes.
These classes take care of storing the skeleton, exporting skeleton to different formats and executing the base manifold mesh algorithm.
Controller is represented by $BMMController$ class.
This class prepares data from model for visualization and handles input from view.
View consists of two parts.
First, is $OpenGL$ window, which displays data provided from controller.
Second, is a Windows form, that provides Graphical User Interface (GUI) elements, which serve to make input easier.

In this chapter we will describe how we implemented our solution.
We will start with used libraries.
Next, we will describe each part of model-view-controller pattern in greater detail.
After that we will show some programmable shaders used in our implementation.
